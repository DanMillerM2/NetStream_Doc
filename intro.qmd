# Introduction {#sec-intro .unnumbered}

NetStream is a library of Fortran programs used for geomorphic analysis, including the construction of attributed stream layers for use in a Geographic Information System [@miller2003]. The methods implemented in this library have proven effective for accurate channel-network delineation and attribution [@clarke2008; @peñas2011; @miller2015]; they form the foundation for the virtual watershed data structure [@barquin2015; @benda2016; @gonzález-ferreras2017] and for the NetMap tools for ArcGIS [@benda2007]. The programs have currently been compiled using the Intel Fortran compiler for the Windows operating system and are run from a command line.
