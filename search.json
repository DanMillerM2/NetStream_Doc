    "text": "Data structures\nWhen considering how to use these programs, it is helpful to understand how they store and use information. With that understanding, you will have an idea of how to phrase the questions you ask of the models implemented in these programs. The underlying conceptual model is that of a virtual watershed (Barquin et al. 2015). A virtual watershed is a digital data structure that characterizes physical attributes (e.g., topography, land cover) over all points and establishes the pathways and processes by which those points are connected. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) provides the spatial template and sets the spatial grain (the finest scale at which any attribute is resolved). A channel network traced from the DEM provides the spatial reference: all locations (DEM grid points or cells) are referenced in terms of their relationship to the channel network.\nThe channel network is recorded digitally using a linked-node-list data structure. Channel courses traced from the DEM extend step-by-step from one DEM grid point to an adjacent point. Each DEM grid point defines a node along the channel course. Each node can reference the adjacent upstream and downstream nodes. Hence, flow paths can be followed both up- and down-stream throughout the DEM.\nEach channel node has an associated list of attributes with information about the point along the channel represented by that node. These attributes include basic information about the channel itself, such as elevation, gradient, and contributing area. They may include information about the contributing area, such as annual precipitation, land cover, and geology.\nImportantly, each DEM grid point, and its corresponding cell, is associated with one or more channel nodes. The associated node, or nodes, may be determined from the gravity-driven flow path as determined from the topography inferred from the DEM- the path that surface water flowing over the ground surface would follow from the DEM grid point to the channel. Each DEM grid point thus has an associated set of attributes relating it to the channel network, including flow distance to the channel it drains to and attributes of that channel, such as size, gradient, and sediment transport capacity.\nLikewise, each channel node has an associated channel-adjacent contributing area defined by those flow paths. These channel-adjacent areas extend outward from the node to each side of the channel, like wings. They are referred to as drainage wings.\nDrainage wings provide a unique discretization of a watershed referenced to the channel network. Attributes of a wing can be assigned to its associated node, including basic measures such as its size and land cover. These attributes may include modeled values, such as estimates of the sediment and organic inputs a wing may provide to the channel. We can divide roads into segments based on intersections with the drainage wings, thus parsing a road network in terms of its potential connectivity with the channel network.\nFlow paths provide indicators of hydrologic connectivity, needed for characterizing processes involving movement of water and water-carried material through a watershed. Other types of processes may require other measures of connectivity, such as the Euclidean (straight line) distance from a DEM grid point to a channel.\nUse of a linked list of channel nodes and discretization of a watershed in terms of associated channel nodes provides an efficient data structure for routing of information across a watershed. The DEM-traced channel network is the framework on which this structure is built, reflected in the name NetStream. The first step for almost all NetStream analyses is creation of that channel network, performed by the program bldgrds. Subsequent programs can read the channel node list created by bldgrds to perform a variety of analyses and to write output shapefiles and raster files readable by a GIS. These programs are listed and described starting with 1  Bldgrds.",

    "title": "Prerequisites",
    "section": "Input Files",
    "text": "Input Files\nPrograms in the NetStream suite all use ASCII (text) input files with a similar file structure and format. The input files specify any input and output file names and locations, specify the tasks to be performed, and provide any parameter values needed to perform those tasks.\n\nKeywords and arguments\nInput files use a “keyword: argument(s)” format. The keyword indicates either what the following arguments are for or indicates a specific task or program option. Entries are identified as a keyword by the following colon (:); any needed arguments follow the keyword; multiple arguments are separated by commas; and if an argument specifies a numerical or logical parameter name, its value is specified after an equal sign. A pound sign (#) indicates a comment; any unrecognized entries are ignored (so if you misspell a keyword, it will be ignored).\nHere is an example keyword: argument pair:\n\nDEM: c:\\data\\Snoqualmie\\elev_snoqualmie\n\nThis is an input line used by many of the programs. It specifies the DEM file to use. The keyword “DEM” is indicated by the colon; the following argument specifies the location (c:\\data\\Snoqualmie\\) and name (elev_snoqualmie) of the DEM file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral things to note about DEM files\n\n\n\n\nNetStream programs use a default file name “elev_ID” for DEMs. The “ID” indicates the dataset name. The programs strip off the ID when the “elev_ID” format is used. Subsequent output files that use default names then get the same ID suffix.\nThe full path is required when specifying a DEM file. The programs strip off the path when reading this input line. Any other DEM-related files required by the program are then looked for in the folder specified by the path.\nNetStream programs can only read three raster-file formats:\n\nbinary floating point (.flt)\ntiff, but only uncompressed or those with LZW compression\nBIL single band (.bil)\n\nIf no extension is included, the file is assumed to be .flt. If an .flt file with that name cannot be found, the program will look for a file with .tif extension.\n\n\n\nHere’s an example with multiple arguments:\n\nOUTPUT NODE POINT SHAPEFILE: c:\\data\\Snoqualmie\\node_test, SPLITS = 4\n\nHere the keyword, or in this case, the keyword phrase (OUTPUT NODE POINT SHAPEFILE) specifies an output file to create. The first argument (c:\\data\\Snoqualmie\\node_test) specifies the location and name of the shapefile to create. The second argument (SPLITS = 4) specifies that the output should be split into four separate shapefiles (this is needed because, for large datasets, ArcGIS can only read shapefile attribute tables of two Gbytes or less).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nKeywords and arguments are case sensitive.\n\n\nEach program has a specific set of keyword: argument pairs that it recognizes. I’ll describe these in the chapters describing the programs.\n\n\nAttribute lists\nFor programs that generate output GIS vector files, either point or polyline shapefiles, the data fields to include in the attribute table are specified with an attribute list. An attribute list is initialized with the “ATTRIBUTE LIST” keyword; the “END LIST” keyword flags the end of the list. Here’s an example:\n\n#===================================\nATTRIBUTE LIST:\n#———————————————————–\nID:\nLENGTH:\nCONTRIBUTING AREA: OUTPUT FIELD = AREA_SQKM\nMEAN ANNUAL PRECIP: FILE = c:/work/data/wrangell/precip_utm8n, OUTPUT FIELD = MNANPRC_M\nVALLEY WIDTH: CHANNEL DEPTHS = 5.0, OUTPUT FIELD = VAL5CW\n#———————————————————–\nEND LIST:\n#===================================\n\nEach keyword within the list specifies an output data field. These are generally attributes recognized by the program and will trigger a call to specific subroutines for calculating the attribute values. If the keyword is not recognized by the program, the data field will be created, but filled with nodata values. A full description of the data-field options available is provided in 2  Attribute Lists.\n\n\nEquations\nA data field specified in an attribute list may be defined by an equation using other data fields in the attribute list. Equations are of the form:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{1.1}^{e_{1.1}}x_{1.2}^{e_{1.2}}... + \\beta_2x_{2.1}^{e_{2.1}}x_{2.2}^{e_{2.2}}...\n\\]\nHere, the \\(\\beta_i\\) and \\(e_{i.j}\\) are empirical coefficients and the \\(x_{i.j}\\) are data-field variables included elsewhere the attribute list. A data-field entry is flagged as an equation by the “EQUATION” argument. The next line(s) specify the constant term \\(\\beta_0\\) with the CONSTANT keyword and each \\(\\beta_ix_{i.j}^{e_{i.j}}\\) term with the TERM keyword. The equation entries are terminated by the END EQUATION keyword. Here is an example:\n\n#==================================\nATTRIBUTE LIST:\n#———————————————————-\nCONTRIBUTIND AREA: OUTPUT FIELD = AreaSQKM\nMEAN ANNUAL PRECIP: FILE = c:\\prism\\prism_utm10n, OUTPUT FIELD = MnAnPrcM # mean annual precipitation in meters depth\nMEAN ANNUAL FLOW: OUTPUT FIELD = MeanAnnCMS, EQUATION # mean annual flow in cubic meters per second\nTERM: FIELD = AREA_SQKM, COEF = 0.014, EXPONENT = 0.99, FIELD = MNANPRC_M, EXPONENT = 1.59\nEND EQUATION:\n#——————————————————–\nEND LIST:\n#===================================\n\nIn this case, the attribute for mean annual flow (MeanAnnCMS) is defined by the equation\n\\[\nMeanAnnCMS = 0.01454(AreaSQKM^{0.99})(MnAnPrcM^{1.593})\n\\]\nwhere AreaSQKM is contributing area and MnAnPrcM is mean annual precipitation. If there were a constant term \\((\\beta_0)\\), it would be specified by a line with keyword “CONSTANT:” followed by an argument with the value. If there were additional \\(\\beta_ix_{i.j}^{e_{i.j}}\\) terms, these would be specified by additional lines with a “TERM:” keyword. This format allows specification of a large variety of equation forms.\n\n\nRaster lists\nData-field attributes can also be calculated from analysis of raster files. For example, we can define a data field that gives the mean gradient or the proportion of the contributing area within each land-cover class over the contributing area to each node, if a gradient or land-cover raster are provided. These tasks are specified using a raster list, initiated with the “RASTER LIST:” keyword.",

    "text": "1.1.1 DEM raster\nThe primary and only required input file is a DEM (keyword DEM FILE), consisting of a raster of elevation values in either binary floating point (.flt) or tiff (.tif) format (only uncompressed or those with LZW compression can currently be read). NetStream programs use a default DEM file name of elev_ID, where “ID” is a character string that identifies the dataset. It is copied from the DEM-file name and applied as a suffix to output data files created from the DEM.\nA variety of optional input files can be used to control placement of channels.\n\n\n1.1.2 GMI raster\nA “Geomorphic Index” raster (keyword GMI RASTER). These are used by the US Geological Survey to aid contractors building elevation-derived hydrography (see New Developments in Elevation-Derived Hydrography Acquisition Specifications and Validation). These prove useful for guiding channel courses in low-relief terrain. The NetStream program FlowCat can be used to build a GMI raster.\n\n\n1.1.3 Topographic Position Index (TPI)\nA topographic position index raster (keyword LOCAL RELIEF RASTER) can be used as a criteria for identifying channel initiation points and/or for guiding channel courses, similar to a GMI raster. The NetStream program makeGrids can be used to build a topographic position raster (also referred to as a local relief raster).\n\n\n1.1.4 Water mask\nOne or more water-mask polygon (or raster) files may be specified (keyword WATER MASK). A water mask delineates areas of open water along larger river channels and is provided as either a polygon shapefile or a raster with nonzero values indicating the mask. Lidar laser signals are largely absorbed by water, so zones of open water lack signal returns in the lidar point cloud. The DEM elevations through these zones are interpolated from signals along the edge of the channel or are set to a constant elevation by hydro-flattening. In either case, the DEM provides no guidance for channel courses through these zones and the traced channel centerlines can wonder back and forth within the zone. Where this occurs, measured channel length will be too long and calculated channel gradients will therefore be too small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe channel here has been hydroflattened in the DEM. The traced channels wonders back and forth between the channel edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a water mask, the traced channel is constrained to flow through the center of the mask polygon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith hydroflattened DEMs, it is possible to create a water mask from the DEM directly. In this case, the water-mask polygon was made using the infrared band of NAIP imagery with the NetStream program waterMaskByTopo, which uses image segmentation of the infrared band combined with topographic filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural color NAIP imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfrared band.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using imagery to generate a water mask, it is important that the date of of the imagery matches the date of lidar acquisition because channel positions may change over time.\n\n\n1.1.5 Road crossings\nOne or more polyline shapefiles can be specified for breaching high points in a DEM (keyword LINE EXCAVATE). With high-resolution DEMs, road prisms are resolved and can act to divert the traced flow paths. Culverts and other drainage structures are not generally visible in the DEM and need to be specified from other data sources. This is typically done by manually digitizing a line that crosses the road prism at known or inferred culvert locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraced channel flow paths without digitized road crossings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraced channel flow paths with digitized road crossings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBldgrds will find the points of highest and lowest elevation along the digitized line and “excavate” a swale following the line from the high point to the low point. The modified DEM is then used for determining flow accumulation and resulting channel courses.\n\n\n1.1.6 Channel mask\nOne or more polyline shapefiles may be specified for drainage enforcement (keyword CHANNEL MASK). Drainage enforcement can be performed in two ways\n\nBy excavating a swale into the DEM along the channel-mask line, a technique referred to as “stream burning”. Keyword arguments specify the depth and width of the swale. Flow directions are then determined for the DEM with the burned-in swale. All elevation derivatives, however, such as channel gradient, are calculated using the original DEM, so if the enforced channel does not follow accurate channel flow paths on the DEM, for example, if it goes up the side of the valley wall, calculated channel attributes will be in error.\nBy setting flow directions to explicitly follow the channel mask line. This over rides flow directions based on elevation relationships in the DEM. Up- and down-stream flow directions are based on the order in which the vertices along the channel mask line occur, so all lines must be digitized in a consistent direction, either all upstream or all downstream. This directional enforcement is triggered with the argument DIRECTIONAL. The default digitization direction assumed is downstream. If digitization is upstream, then the argument UPSTREAM is required.\n\nA combination of both burning in and directional enforcement can be used. In that case, the flow directions are set by the digitized line and the depth and width of the swale determine the distance overwhich flow is directed towards the enforced channel.\nChannel masks are useful for guiding channel locations through low-relief areas where the DEM topography provides little guidance or to force traced channels to match an existing stream layer.",

These values typically range from zero up to four, because four topographic indices are typically used to generate a GMI raster.

Everything else has user-defined options, although default values are built in for most.\nBasin topography is found to exhibit certain scaling relationships between contributing area and gradient that delineate divergent, convergent, and channelized topography (Ijjasz-Vasquez and Bras, 1995). We capitalize on these to calibrate threshold values for channel initiation. Following Clarke et al. (2008), we plot channel density as a function of the ASe value and look for the inflection in log-log plots that indicate a transition to the channelized regime. See Slide 4. This provides a ball-park estimate of the threshold value appropriate for the terrain as represented with the DEM. Plots are produced separately for steep terrain and low-gradient terrain, under the assumption that channel-forming processes may differ, e.g., landsliding on steep terrain and fluvial erosion on low-gradient terrain.

Depending on the shape of the ground surface interpolated from the 9 elevation values at the midpoints of the cells, each adjacent cell may contribute all, some portion, or none of its area to the central cell and the central cell may contribute all, some portion, or none of its area (and the accumulated area of the upslope cells that flows into it) to each of the adjacent cells. The simplest strategy is to have all flow from the central cell go to one of the 8 adjacent cells. This is the “D-8” flow-direction algorithm (Jenson and Domingue, 1988). It provides a poor estimate of contributing area to a cell that is biased by the 8 flow-direction options. One must also decide which of the 8 adjacent cells to direct flow to, and there are a variety of strategies for that. When D-8 flow paths are needed, we use the D8-LTD algorithm (Orlandini et al., 2003), which corrects for the directional bias. A variety of flow-direction algorithms have been developed that accommodate flow in any direction and can direct flow to multiple downslope adjacent cells (Wilson et al., 2008) and thus allow for flow dispersion. We use the D-infinity algorithm (Tarboton, 1997), which allows flow into one or two adjacent cells. Flow accumulation is then calculated using the D-infinity flow directions, until the criteria for channel initiation are met. Downslope of that point, we use D-8 to prevent flow dispersion out of the channel.\nClosed depressions. These may be actual depressions with no outflow, in which case all inflowing water infiltrates to groundwater, or they be actual depressions with an outflow not visible from the DEM (e.g., road prisms with culverts), or they may be artifacts or errors in the DEM. In general, we want to define a flow path to an outlet from the DEM for every DEM cell. Even for closed depressions with no outlet, water that flows into them exits through some groundwater flow path and eventually flows to a stream somewhere downslope or out of the area represented with the DEM. Two primary approaches are used to deal with closed depressions.\n\nFilling. This is the simplest. The depression is filled to the elevation of its lowest pour point (where water would spill out if the depression were filled). Flow directions through the closed depression are then directed toward the pour point. This option destroys any information about flow directions within the closed depression, which we would rather avoid.\nCarving. A path is carved from the depression pour point to the lowest point in the depression and from to a location along the flow path from the pour point where the elevation becomes less than or equal to the lowest point in the depression. Flow within the depression is then directed to the lowest point and then out of the depression along the carved path (Soille et al., 2003). The flow paths from the pour point heading into and away from the depression follow D8-LTD flow directions. This is the preferred option and the one used in bldgrds. \n\nChannel initiation. We need to specify the conditions where channels initiate. This determines the upslope extent of the channel network and the channel density. We have several strategies:\n\nLocal topographic position. For high-resolution DEMs interpolated from high-density ground returns (e.g., &gt;1/m2), channels are visible directly in the DEM. Channels can be highlighted using a measure of local topographic position (LTP), which provides an indicator of the elevation of a DEM grid point relative to its neighbors. Absolute LTP measures give the difference in elevation of the grid point compared to the mean or median grid-point elevations within a specified circular neighborhood. Relative measures normalize that elevation difference by some measure of elevation variability in the neighborhood. Deviation from mean elevation (DEV), for example, divides the difference from mean elevation by the standard deviation of DEM grid-point elevations within the neighborhood (Newman et al., 2018). Thus, a small channel incised 0.25 meters traversing flat, low-relief terrain (with a small standard deviation in elevation values) will have a large DEV value compared to a small channel incised 0.25 meters traversing steep, rough terrain (with a larger standard deviation). For determining upslope channel extent, we can specify an LTP threshold value and exclude channel initiation in areas where the LTP value is greater than that threshold (i.e., channel incision is too small). One must decide on whether to use an absolute or relative measure and on the appropriate length scale for the local neighborhood. I find an absolute measure easier to interpret than a relative measure, because it provides a direct estimate of the depth of channel incision; I can decide that traced channels begin only when a channel is incised to more than 0.2 meters (LTP &lt; -0.2), for example. The radius to choose for the local neighborhood should be set relative to the resolution of the DEM, the roughness of the terrain (greater roughness requires larger neighborhoods), and the smallest width of channels you want to identify. Typically, at their upslope extent, channels are less than a meter wide, so a radius of five meters or more will suffice for calculating LTP. See slides 1-2 for examples in the Sprague basin. \nArea-slope threshold. Where the ground-return point density is insufficient to resolve channels at their upslope extent, we need to infer channel-initiation locations. One strategy for this is to estimate where on the landscape there is sufficient flowing water to erode a channel. The contributing (drainage) area to any point on the landscape indicates the upslope area from which overland flow and water infiltrating to shallow subsurface flow through the soil can originate. Hence, differences in contributing area provide indicators of relative differences in overland- and shallow-subsurface discharge; greater contributing area implies greater discharge. This is the idea behind using thresholds in contributing area to estimate upslope channel extent: for a given climate and terrain, some minimum contributing area is required for sufficient discharge to erode a channel. The erosive power of water depends not only on how much water there is, but also on the steepness of the slope it is flowing over or through. Hence, threshold values for functions of contributing area and ground-surface slope may provide better indicators of where channels initiate than contributing area alone. We use the function ASe, where A is contributing area, S is tangent of the ground-surface gradient, and e is a user-specified exponent (Montgomery and Foufoula-Georgiou, 1993). Contributing area may be specified as specific contributing area, which is the contributing area divided by the length of a contour line crossed by flow exiting the DEM cell (Gallant and Hutchinson, 2011). This accounts for effects of topographic convergence and divergence on the depth of flow and is the default in bldgrds. \n\n\n\n\nPlan curvature. Plan curvature measures the rate of change in elevation measured in a direction tangent to a contour line; it indicates the curvature of the contour. Tangential curvature is similar, but measures the rate of change relative to a plane oriented tangent to the ground surface, whereas plan curvature measures curvature relative to a horizontal plane (Minár et al., 2020). Both provide another measure for topographic indication of presence of a channel. Bldgrds has the option to specify thresholds of plan (or tangential) curvature for channel initiation. These thresholds can be determined by building curvature rasters using the makegrids program, classifying by proposed threshold values, and plotting on a shaded relief image to see where a proposed threshold would allow channel initiation. The LTP thresholds described above provide a similar and more easily interpreted method of using topography inferred from the DEM for identifying channels.\nMinimum flow length. Bldgrds iteratively traverses every flow path within a DEM in a downslope direction and checks each cell to see if it meets the channel-initiation criteria. As seen in the images of slides 1, 2, and 5, the criteria can be met for some portion of the flow path, but then no longer be met further downslope. Bldgrds requires specification of the minimum length over which the initiation criteria must be met before it will initialize a channel. The appropriate length depends on the resolution of the DEM and on the roughness of the terrain. If topographic channel indicators are indistinct, small zones where initiation thresholds are met can arise from noise in the DEM or small-scale roughness in the terrain. \n\n\n\nChannel courses. The cell-to-cell D8 flow paths used once channel initiation is met do not always follow the same course that the actual channels do. Sometimes evidence of the channel flow path is not visible in the DEM, sometimes there are multiple options, sometimes noise in the DEM misdirects the flow path. It can help to use information from DEM cells beyond those immediately adjacent and to bring in information from other data sources. Here are options used by bldgrds.\n\nFlow indicators. Topographic indicators of a channel can also be used to guide channelized flow paths. The flowcat program (for flow categorization) uses one to four such indicators: 1) a threshold in flow accumulation calculated with D-infinity flow directions and no channel initiation, 2) geomorphon valley and pit types (Stepinski and Jasiewicz. J, 2011; Jasiewicz and Stepinski, 2013), 3) a threshold in plan (or tangential) curvature, and 4) a threshold for deviation from mean elevation (DEV). FlowCat creates a raster with each cell indicating the number of specified flow indicators that are met at each DEM cell. If all four indicators are used, then raster values range from 0 to 4. Bldgrds preferentially directs channels towards raster-cell values greater than zero, or greater than a specified minimum (e.g., if all four indicators are used, a minimum of two indicators must be met). This is done by excavating the corresponding cells in the DEM by a multiple of the flow-indicator raster. \nWater mask. Infrared laser signals are absorbed by water so there are no signal returns from open water. Lidar DEMs often have areas of water “hydroflattened”, so that the open-water zone has a single uniform elevation or a uniformly downstream decreasing elevation. In other cases, elevations over the open-water zone are interpolated from ground returns on either side, which can generate noisy DEM elevation values through the zone of open water. This can result in zig-zaggy flow paths, which then overestimate channel length and affect values of corresponding derivatives, such channel gradient. We want channel flow paths through zones of open water to be smooth and to track through the center of the open-water zone. To accomplish that, provide bldgrds with a separate raster or polygonal water-mask layer. Bldgrds will direct flow paths through the center of these zones. In some cases, breaklines for hydroflattening are provided with lidar-derived DEMs. In other cases, we can build a water mask using multi-band imagery. Open water appears dark in infra-red bands and can be delineated using image segmentation. Program waterMaskByTopo can generate a water-mask raster using the infrared band from e.g., NAIP. It also uses thresholds in DEV and gradient to distinguish shadows. \nDEM derivatives. Azimuth, plan curvature, and the direction of steepest descent can also be used with varying degrees of influence to guide channelized flow directions. Azimuth and plan curvature are measured over a specified length scale. By specifying a length greater than the DEM grid-point spacing, azimuth and curvature use information beyond the elevation of adjacent points, which can reduce the influence of noise in the DEM. It can also cause flow paths to deviate from the steepest-descent path to an adjacent cell. One or more of these indicators may be used and, if more than one are specified, different degrees of influence can be specified for each. The choice of indicators, of length scales, and of the degree of influence to specify requires iterative experimentation.\nFlow diversions. High-resolution lidar DEMs resolve road prisms and other potential blockages to channel flow. The carving algorithm used to drain closed depressions will often trace the correct flow path, but not in all cases. If these apparent blockages have drainage structures, such as culverts, not visible in the DEM, these need to be specified from other data sources. Typically, such other data sources are not available, and the likely locations of culverts need to be manually digitized. This task is iterative: building a stream layer, looking for diversions, digitizing a culvert or drainage location, rebuilding the stream layer, and repeating until satisfied with the stream layer. \n\n\n\n\n\nUse thresholds of local relief for low- and high-gradient terrain, along with \narea-slope thresholds to limit the extent that channel features resolvable in the DEM are traced upslope. \n\n\n\nUse elevation derivatives of azimuth and plan curvature, with these values calculated over length scales sufficient to span several DEM cells. \nUse a water mask derived using the waterMaskByTopo program with the infrared NAIP band. \nIterative correction of flow diversions.",

    "text": "3.2 Linked node data structure\nThe channel network traced by bldgrds is represented using a linked-node data structure. A channel node is created for each DEM grid point along the channel flow path. Each channel node is connected to one or more upstream nodes and to one downstream node. (The data structure can accommodate multiple downstream nodes, but I haven’t fully implemented that yet. We need it to route through anastomosing channel networks, but I’m still working on efficient and robust ways to trace through networks with multiple loops). Each node has an associated set of attributes. This set may include such attributes as elevation, contributing area, channel geometry, channel gradient, and a variety of others available through instructions specified in the input files to the programs. Each node is associated with a DEM grid point, but node locations may be displaced from the grid point to accommodate smooth flow paths. \nBldgrds builds a binary data file that stores the channel-node list that specifies the node locations and the node-to-node connections. Any subsequent program that uses the traced channel network reads this file to construct the channel network. The file is named nodeNet_ID.dat, where “ID” is a text string used to identify a dataset. \ninsert figure",
